Explanation of the Program:
Item Class:

The Item class represents an individual product in the billing system, containing properties like itemName, quantity, and price.
The getTotalPrice() method calculates the total price for that particular item (quantity * price).
The displayItem() method displays the item details including the total price for that item.
OnlineBillingSystem Class:

The main class that holds an ArrayList of Item objects.
The addItem() method allows users to enter the name, quantity, and price for an item and add it to the itemsList.
The generateBill() method displays the bill by iterating over the itemsList and showing each itemâ€™s details and the total price.
Main Menu:

The program displays a simple menu with options to add an item, generate a bill, or exit.
Based on user input, the program either adds an item or generates a bill, or exits.
How to Run the Program:
Compile and run the OnlineBillingSystem class.
Follow the instructions on the console to add items and generate the bill.
You can keep adding items and generate a final bill after all items are added.
This is a basic example to get you started. You can extend the system by adding features like:

Discounts or offers.
Handling different payment methods (e.g., cash, credit card).
Saving the bill to a file or database.
